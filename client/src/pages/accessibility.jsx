        <li>We’re using clear, descriptive language so you know what’s up.</li>
        <li>We’re optimizing our images and videos with alt text and captions, so no one misses out.</li>
        <li>We’re making sure our site is navigable with a keyboard, because we love accessibility.</li>
        <li>We’re regularly testing our site to catch any hiccups and keep everything smooth sailing.</li>
