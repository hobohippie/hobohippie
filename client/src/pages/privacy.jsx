        Hey there, friend! At Hobo Hippie, we totally respect your privacy and are committed to keeping

        in the chillest way possible.
      </p>

      <h2>What Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We gather some info when you visit our site, like your name, email address, and any other 
        details you share with us when you make a purchase or sign up for our newsletter. Don’t sweat it, 
        though—we’re all about good vibes, and we only ask for what we need to keep the good times rollin’.

        <li>Process your orders and deliver those sweet herbal remedies.</li>
        <li>Keep you in the loop with cool updates and offers (if you opt-in, of course).</li>
        <li>Improve our website and services, making sure you have the grooviest experience possible.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        We keep your info close to our hearts and won’t share it with anyone outside of our little 
        Hobo Hippie family—unless it’s necessary to complete your order or if the law tells us to. 
        We promise to treat your data like the precious flower it is!
